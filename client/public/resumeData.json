My approach to work and school projects has been to research, and analyze the assignment, to collect ideas then create a solution, and finally to make a product that is uniquely crafted to suit the needs of the user. Some technologies I gravitate toward utilizing are UNIX-based operating systems (macOS, Linux, BSD), HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React among others.","contactmessage":"Contact me via E-Mail anytime.
